1. What is API?
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software applications. 

2. Use Cases of API:

Integration: APIs allow different software systems to communicate and share data with each other, enabling seamless integration.
Data Retrieval: APIs are commonly used to retrieve data from external sources, like databases or web services.
Automation: APIs enable automation by allowing different software systems to interact programmatically.
3. Example of Using API with Python:

Let's use the OpenWeatherMap API to get the current weather for a specific city.
python
Copy code
import requests

api_key = "API_KEY"
city = "London"


response = requests.get(f"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={api_key}")


if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    temperature = data['main']['temp']
    print(f"The current temperature in {city} is {temperature}Â°C")
else:
    print(f"Failed to retrieve weather data. Status code: {response.status_code}")
4. Limitations of API:

Rate Limits: Many APIs have rate limits, restricting the number of requests a user can make within a certain timeframe.
Security: Improperly secured APIs may expose sensitive data or lead to unauthorized access.
Limited Functionality: Some APIs may not provide all the functionalities needed for a specific use case.
