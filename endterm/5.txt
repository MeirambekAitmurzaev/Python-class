**1. What is a Socket?**
A socket is a low-level programming abstraction that provides a communication endpoint for sending or receiving data between two processes over a computer network. Sockets allow processes on different devices to communicate, enabling data exchange and interaction.

**2. Use Cases of Sockets:**
   - **Networking Applications:** Sockets are fundamental for building networking applications, including chat applications, file transfer protocols, and more.
   - **Client-Server Communication:** Sockets facilitate communication between client and server applications in a client-server architecture.
   - **Real-Time Systems:** Sockets are often used in real-time systems where low-latency communication is crucial, such as online gaming or financial trading platforms.
   - **Distributed Systems:** Sockets enable communication between processes running on different machines in distributed systems.

**3. Example of Using Sockets with Python:**
   - Below is a simple example of a server and client using sockets in Python for a basic echo service. The server echoes back any message it receives from a client.

**Server Code:**
```python
import socket


server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)


server_address = ('localhost', 8888)
server_socket.bind(server_address)


server_socket.listen(1)
print('Waiting for a connection...')


client_socket, client_address = server_socket.accept()
print(f'Connection from {client_address}')


data = client_socket.recv(1024)
print(f'Received: {data.decode()}')
client_socket.sendall(data)


client_socket.close()
server_socket.close()
```


```python
import socket


client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)


server_address = ('localhost', 8888)
client_socket.connect(server_address)


message = "Hello, server!"
client_socket.sendall(message.encode())


data = client_socket.recv(1024)
print(f'Received: {data.decode()}')


client_socket.close()
```

This example demonstrates a basic client-server interaction using sockets in Python.
